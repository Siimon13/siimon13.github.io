	<h1> About Me </h1>
	<p> Hi, My name is Simon Chen. I am a senior at NYU School of Engineering, studying computer science. I have a GPA of 3.5 and a major GPA of 3.7. I am a New York Native, StuyCS, L4L, T4 Alumunus. I'm a maker. I love going to hackathons and working on projects I'm passionate about, from smart cane technology to a messenger chatbot.</p>

	<br> 
	<p> I got started coding in my 2nd year in highschool. I immediately fell in love with the ability to create anything.  For the class, I built a mario-inspired game with NetLogo. Over the years, I've dipped my feet in several fields: AI, Database, Graphics, Systems, and WebDev. I'm still not sure what field I want to go into, but I do know I want to continue making. This semester, I've decided to learn more </p>

	<br>
	<p>I've worked as a Software Engineer Intern for Joinery, MakerSpace Technician for NYU, and Research Assistant for NYU's Department of Technology Management and Innovation. This summer, I will be a Software Engineer Intern for CME Group. I am also the lead backend engineer for Dynable.</p>

	<br>
	<p>On to equally important things, I'm a giant foodie too! I love trying out different types of food from biryani to kobe. My current favorite place is Takashi. If you have a recommendation, drop me a message.</p>
